# BleepingSoftware

Provisioning and configuring an ESP32 should not be such a complex process, that's why we built Bleeping Software!

With minimal set of funtions on top of the Arduino BLE stack combined with our Flutter app compiled for a number of different devices, provisioning your ESP32 has never been easier.

## BleepingLibrary

Designed to be the configuration store for your ESP32 application, the BleepingLibrary should be loaded when the device first boots, and if required, launch into setup and provisioning mode.

### Features

- Provisioning Mode
- Basic Device Control and Information
- Custom Configuration
- Custom BLE Callbacks
